Usage
=====

Always use channel access put callback when setting parameters.

If any of the parameters set are out of range or fail in some way, then the PV will be put into alarm state. This should be checked after every PV set.

An example palette file for a TIFF file is GREY.PAL in the iocAndor directory.
